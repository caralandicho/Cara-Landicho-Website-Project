      <h1>College</h1>
        <h3>The Master's College</h3>
          <p>I was a junior in high school when our guidance counselor told us of a Christian college
          in America that they were collaborating with. It seemed interesting to me but I didn't really
          consider it until during the summer before my senior year, the Philippines GO team of 
          <a href="http://masters.edu">TMC</a> came and helped us in our community service. It was there where 
          I got to meet Dr. Lisa LaGeorge and she and my guidance counselor encouraged me to try and apply. 
          After that, the rest was history!
          </p>
        <h3>Life @ TMC</h3>
          <p> Currently, I am a freshman international student in The Master's College! I live in HOTCHKISS
          Upper Front and am having an awesome time. For the past few months, I have seen myself grow in
          different aspects: spritually, emotionally and mentally. I've also been able to develop many 
          friendships here and am looking forward to the next three years of my college life.
