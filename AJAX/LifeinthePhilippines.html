    <h1>Life in the Philippines</h1>
      <p>
      The Philippines is a small country located in Southeast Asia. Being that we were
      colonized by the Spaniards for 300 years and the Americans for about 50 years, I guess
      we can say that our culture is a mix of the West and Asia combined. With its two major
      languages as Filipino and English, quite a few Filipinos are bilingual. This
      doesn't count the fact that the Philippines also has plenty of dialects (Tagalog is
      its main one) which means that there are Filipinos that can speak Tagalog, English, and
      another Filipino dialect too.

      An interesting fact about the Philippines is that it is a third-world country. A
      misconception that I would like to correct though is that the term "third-world
      country" does not automatically mean that the country has no running water or electricity.
      The term "third-world" country only means that it is a developing country and this
      is probably used to describe the Philippines as we are much behind with things such as
      technology development and the like. Also, many Filipinos are below the poverty line
      which is probably another factor.

      With over 7,000 islands, the Philippines is divided into three main "lands" or pulo
      as we call it: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Luzon is the biggest pulo in the Philippines
      and is also where the capital, Manila (also where I grew up), is located.

      The main religion of the Philippines is Catholicism. In Mindanao, the dominant religion
      is Muslim which causes some problems in the country (a small civil war).

      Being a tropical country rich with resources, the main industries of the Philippines are
      farming and fishing. Agriculture in the Philippines though is very different from agriculture
      in America. Usually, we grow things such as pineapples, rice (our staple food), sugar canes etc.
