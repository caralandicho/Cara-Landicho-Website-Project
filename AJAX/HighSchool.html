    <h1>High School</h1>
      <p> 
      My high school life was quite the learning experience for me. I studied in a 
      Christian school called GCF International Christian School and got to meet some
      of the greatest people in my life!

      A fun thing about my school is its passion for the arts. We have different guilds
      or clubs that complement the different talents of the students. In high school, we
      had four guilds: Theospian (drama), Psalm 100 (singing), Psalm 33:3 (band), Audience
      of One (dance) and the "Secret Service" (production). Because of this, our school
      has a major production every year to showcase the different talents of the guilds.
      Aside from that, each year level in high school also had as a requirement an English
      Play and a Filipino play as a final exam for a quarter. This meant that we had about
      a total of 17-18 plays per year!

      I really enjoyed being in my high school with all the fun and memories I have. I also
      got to develop my relationship with God and learn about Him and His creation even more.
      It was also this high school that God used as an instrument for me to end up in TMC.
